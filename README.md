# crawl-score

Grabs some data from the Crawl hi-score page:

http://crawl.akrasiac.org/scoring/top-N.html

and aims to build on some of the suggestions from this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/dcss/comments/ep7k0u/top_scores_visualization/

Goals

1. sit on a pi or a vm and periodically download and store hi score data from the web page

2. at a glance, summarise changes in scores from previous download

3. from the stored data, provide a visualisation of scoring over time

4. provide a handful of other interesting facts from the data
